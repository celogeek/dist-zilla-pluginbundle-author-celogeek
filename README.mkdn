    [MetaConfig]
    [PodWeaver]
    config_plugin = @Celogeek
    [Run::BeforeRelease]
    run = cp %d%pREADME.mkdn .
    [PerlTidy]
    perltidyrc = xt/perltidy.rc
    [Test::Perl::Critic]
    critic_config = xt/perlcritic.rc

It also install :

    Devel::Cover
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::cover

Here a simple dist.ini :

    name = MyTest
    license = Perl_5
    copyright_holder = celogeek <me@celogeek.com>
    copyright_year = 2011
    

    [@Author::Celogeek]

And it support remove, so you can use it for your apps deploy :

    name = MyTest
    license = Perl_5
    copyright_holder = celogeek <me@celogeek.com>
    copyright_year = 2011
    

    [@Author::Celogeek]
    -remove = UploadToCPAN
    [Run::Release]
    run = scripts/deploy.sh %s

Here my Changes file :

    {{$NEXT}}
      My changes log

Here my .gitignore :

    xt/perltidy.rc
    xt/perlcritic.rc
    MyTest-*
    *.swp
    *.bak
    *.tdy
    *.old
    .build
    .includepath
    .project
    .DS_Store

You need to create and commit at least the .gitignore Changes and dist.ini and your lib first. Then any release will be automatic.

When you will release, by invoking 'dzil release', it will automatically:

- increment the version number (you dont add it in your program)
- collect change found in your Changes after the NEXT
- collect the markdown for github
- commit Changes, dist.ini and README.mkdn with a simple message (version and changes)
- add a tag
- push origin
